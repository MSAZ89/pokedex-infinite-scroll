# About

A pokedex with an infinite scroll and a search bar. Consumes the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to get the data and https://unpkg.com/pokeapi-sprites@2.0.2 for images.

The images are in svg format so unless you've loaded them previously, there's a delay when you first load a pokemon image.
